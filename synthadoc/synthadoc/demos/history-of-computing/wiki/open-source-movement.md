# Open Source Movement

The open source movement established that software whose source code is publicly available and freely modifiable could be commercially and technically superior to proprietary alternatives. It transformed how software is produced, distributed, and governed.

## Richard Stallman and GNU (1983)

Richard Stallman, a programmer at MIT's AI Lab, announced the GNU Project in 1983 with the goal of creating a completely free Unix-compatible operating system. In 1985 he published the GNU Manifesto and founded the Free Software Foundation. In 1989 he released the GNU General Public License (GPL) — the copyleft licence that requires derivative works to remain free. GNU produced essential tools (gcc, bash, glibc) that underpin [[unix-history]]-derived systems to this day.

## Linux (1991)

Linus Torvalds, a Finnish student, released the Linux kernel in 1991, famously announcing it as "just a hobby, won't be big and professional." Combined with GNU tools, the GNU/Linux system became the first complete free operating system. Linux is now the dominant kernel in servers, cloud infrastructure, Android devices, and embedded systems. Its development model — thousands of contributors coordinated through patches and version control — influenced how all large software projects are managed.

## The Cathedral and the Bazaar (1999)

Eric Raymond's essay contrasted two development models: the cathedral (closed, small team, periodic releases) versus the bazaar (open, many contributors, continuous releases). The bazaar model's success with Linux challenged conventional software engineering wisdom. The essay directly influenced Netscape's decision to open-source its browser code, leading to Mozilla Firefox.

## Open Source Initiative and Licensing

The Open Source Initiative (OSI), founded in 1998 by Bruce Perens and Eric Raymond, formalised the "open source" definition and approved licences. The spectrum of licences — GPL (copyleft), MIT/BSD (permissive), Apache — reflects different philosophies about freedom and commercial use. GitHub (2008) lowered the barrier to participation further, making open source the default for new software infrastructure.

## Impact

Open source now underpins virtually all internet infrastructure: Linux servers, Apache/Nginx web servers, MySQL/PostgreSQL databases, Python and JavaScript runtimes, containerisation (Docker, Kubernetes). The [[internet-origins]] web runs almost entirely on open source software. Open source also became the standard publishing model for [[artificial-intelligence-history]] research, with models and frameworks released publicly.

See also: [[unix-history]] for the operating system that open source first replicated; [[programming-languages-overview]] for how open-source languages (Python, Ruby, Rust) came to dominate.

## Linus Torvalds and Linux (1991)
In 1991, Finnish computer science student Linus Torvalds at the University of Helsinki created the Linux kernel as a free operating system kernel. Combined with the GNU userland tools and utilities (compiler, shell, coreutils), Linux plus GNU formed the first complete free Unix-like operating system, often called GNU/Linux. ^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:17,19]

## Eric S. Raymond and the Bazaar Model
Software developer Eric S. Raymond documented the open source development methodology in "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" (1997), contrasting the hierarchical "cathedral" model of proprietary development with the distributed "bazaar" model of open collaboration that powered Linux. ^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:25,27]

## Economic and Cultural Transformation
The synthesis of GNU tools and the Linux kernel transformed software production economics over two decades, enabling massive collaborative development and disrupting traditional proprietary software business models. ^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:3,19]

## Linux and the GNU Project (1991)

In August 1991, 21-year-old Linus Torvalds, a university student in Helsinki, Finland, announced a new Unix-like kernel that would eventually become Linux. The timing was significant: the GNU Project had already created most of a free Unix-compatible operating system—except for a working kernel. When Torvalds released his kernel, it filled this critical gap, allowing the GNU tools to run on a complete, free operating system. ^[0825-torvalds-starts-linux:20,25-29,16-19]

The combination of GNU utilities (the compiler, editors, shells, and core utilities) with Torvalds' Linux kernel created a powerful alternative to commercial Unix systems. This synergy made Linux the flagship success of the free software movement. ^[0825-torvalds-starts-linux:16-19,37-38]

Thousands of volunteers worldwide contributed to Linux's development, testing, documentation, and distribution. This volunteer-driven model proved that collaborative, community-built software could compete with—and often surpass—commercially developed operating systems. ^[0825-torvalds-starts-linux:13,39]

## Linux Foundation 2016 Report (25th Anniversary)

The Linux Foundation released a comprehensive report in August 2016 documenting the state of Linux kernel development. This report demonstrates the remarkable scale of collaborative open-source development achieved by the community.^[lf_pub_whowriteslinux2016.pdf:9-9]

### Development Scale

The kernel represents one of the largest collaborative software projects globally:
- Over 10,000 patches per release from more than 1,600 developers
- Developers representing over 200 corporations
- Since 2005, approximately 14,000 developers from 1,300 companies have contributed^[lf_pub_whowriteslinux2016.pdf:21-23]
^[lf_pub_whowriteslinux2016.pdf:22-23]
^[lf_pub_whowriteslinux2016.pdf:24-25]

### Releases Covered (2015-2016)

The report covers releases 3.19 through 4.7 (released July 2016), highlighting the rapid development pace with nine major releases during this period.^[lf_pub_whowriteslinux2016.pdf:28-29]
^[lf_pub_whowriteslinux2016.pdf:29-29]

### Significance

These statistics demonstrate how competing technology companies successfully collaborate on shared infrastructure, validating the open-source development model that [[linus-torvalds]] pioneered and that the [[open-source-movement]] advocates. The Linux kernel serves as the canonical example of how freely modifiable source code can outperform proprietary alternatives through mass collaboration.

## Research Community Origins and Ethical Framing

The open source movement emerged from the research computing community and ethical advocacy of Richard Stallman in the 1980s. Stallman launched the GNU Project in 1983 with the goal of creating a free Unix-compatible operating system, driven by philosophical beliefs about software freedom. He established the Free Software Foundation in 1985 to formalize these efforts, and later published the GNU General Public License (GPL) in 1989 to ensure that software remain freely distributable.^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:3,9,11]

## Convergence with Linux

Meanwhile, Linus Torvalds developed the Linux kernel in 1991. When combined with the GNU tools and utilities, this produced the first complete free Unix-like operating system. This convergence marked a pivotal moment in computing history, as it created a viable free alternative to proprietary Unix systems.^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:17,19]

## Market Transformation

The combined GNU/Linux system grew to dominate servers, cloud infrastructure, and eventually mobile devices through Android. The movement fundamentally transformed the economics and culture of software production, establishing that publicly available source code could be commercially and technically superior to proprietary alternatives. This shift reshaped how software is produced, distributed, and governed worldwide.^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:21]

See also: [[linus-torvalds]] for more on the Linux kernel development.

## Eric S. Raymond and Open Source Methodology

Eric S. Raymond emerged as a key thinker in the open source movement, particularly through his influential essay "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" (1997). Raymond's analysis of the development model behind Linux and the success of collaborative, distributed software development helped articulate why open source approaches could produce superior software. His work contributed significantly to the movement's philosophical and methodological foundations, demonstrating how transparent, community-driven development could rival traditional proprietary software engineering. ^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:25-31]

The collaborative development model that Raymond described transformed software production economics and culture, enabling distributed contributors worldwide to collaborate on projects like the Linux kernel, leading to faster innovation cycles and more robust software through collective review and contribution. ^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:19-21]

## Historical Overview

The open source software movement traces its roots to the early 1980s when richard-stallman, a programmer at the mit-artificial-intelligence-laboratory, launched the gnu-project in 1983 with the goal of creating a completely free Unix-compatible operating system. In 1985 he published the GNU Manifesto and founded the free-software-foundation. The gnu-general-public-license-gpl, a copyleft license, was released in 1989 to ensure that modified versions of GNU software remained free. ^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:7-11]

A pivotal moment came in 1991 when [[linus-torvalds]], a computer science student at the university-of-helsinki, began developing what would become the linux kernel. Torvalds released the kernel under the GPL in 1992, enabling collaboration with the GNU project and thousands of volunteer developers worldwide. The collaborative development model, famously described by eric-s-raymond in his essay "The Cathedral and the Bazaar," demonstrated that open, peer-reviewed development could produce software of exceptional quality and reliability. ^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:17-21]

These efforts transformed software production economics and culture. Linux became dominant in servers, cloud computing, and embedded systems, proving that open source software could be commercially and technically superior to proprietary alternatives. The movement established that software whose source code is publicly available and freely modifiable could drive innovation across the entire computing industry. ^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:3-4]

## Linux and GNU: A Transformative Combination

In 1991, Finnish computer science student [[linus-torvalds]] created the Linux kernel, initially as a personal project.^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:17-17]

When combined with the GNU tools and utilities developed by the Free Software Foundation, it produced the first complete free Unix-like operating system.^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:19-19]

This combination — often called GNU/Linux — became one of the most significant achievements in open source software history.

## Impact on Software Economics and Culture

The open source movement fundamentally transformed software economics and culture. The GNU General Public License (GPL) became the most widely used open source license, providing legal framework for collaborative development.^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:11-11]

Linux came to dominate servers, cloud infrastructure, mobile devices (Android), and embedded systems worldwide.^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:21-21]

The movement demonstrated that publicly available source code that could be freely modified could be commercially and technically superior to proprietary alternatives, changing how software is produced, distributed, and governed.

## GNU and Linux: Forming a Complete Free Operating System

While the GNU Project produced a complete suite of Unix-compatible tools — including the GCC compiler, bash shell, and glibc — by the early 1990s it lacked a working kernel (the HURD kernel remained unfinished). This gap was filled in 1991 when [[linus-torvalds|Linus Torvalds]], a computer science student at the University of Helsinki, released the Linux kernel, initially targeting Intel 386 hardware.^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:13-17]

The combination of GNU tools with the Linux kernel produced the first complete free Unix-like operating system. Crucially, Torvalds adopted the GPL for Linux, ensuring that the combined GNU/Linux system remained free software. The distributed, collaborative development model that emerged — with contributors worldwide submitting code via the internet — became a template for large-scale open source collaboration.^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:17-21]

## Eric Raymond and the Open Source Philosophy

Eric S. Raymond emerged as a key voice articulating and popularizing the open source development philosophy. His writings would help frame free software not merely as an ethical stance, as richard-stallman had done, but as a pragmatic methodology capable of producing superior software through open, distributed development — a perspective that would shape how the movement was perceived and adopted by industry.^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:25-29]

## GNU–Linux Convergence and the Rise of a Complete Free OS
The GNU Project succeeded in developing nearly all essential components of a Unix-like operating system — including the gcc-compiler, bash-shell, and core utilities — but lacked a working kernel. In 1991, [[linus-torvalds]] released [[linux-v0-01]], a monolithic kernel developed independently but compatible with GNU tools. Though Stallman initially advocated for the GNU Hurd kernel, the pragmatic combination of GNU userland and the Linux kernel rapidly coalesced into what users call "GNU/Linux" — a fully functional, freely modifiable operating system. This convergence was enabled and sustained by the gnu-general-public-license, whose copyleft provisions ensured that derivative works remained free, fostering unprecedented collaboration across institutions and continents.^[13:13-14:14,17:17-18:18,19:19-20:20,11:11-12:12]

## Cultural and Economic Transformation
The success of GNU/Linux demonstrated that large-scale, high-reliability software could be built without centralized control. Eric S. Raymond’s 1997 essay "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" — inspired by Torvalds’ development model — helped popularize open development practices beyond the FSF’s ethical framework. Together, Stallman’s philosophical rigor and Torvalds’ engineering pragmatism reshaped software economics, infrastructure (e.g., web servers, cloud platforms), and developer culture — laying groundwork for modern collaborative platforms like GitHub and open standards governance.^[25:25-26:26,27:27-28:28,31:31-32:32,41:41-42:42,43:43]

## Completing the Free Operating System: GNU and Linux (1991)

While richard-stallman's gnu-project had by the late 1980s produced nearly all the components needed for a complete free Unix-like operating system — compilers, shells, text editors, and userland utilities — one critical piece remained missing: the kernel. ^[FILENAME:13-13] This gap was filled in 1991 when [[linus-torvalds]], then a computer science student at the university-of-helsinki, released the linux kernel as free software. ^[FILENAME:17-17] The combination of GNU tools with the Linux kernel produced the first complete free Unix-like operating system, often referred to as GNU/Linux. ^[FILENAME:19-19]

This merger demonstrated the power of the free software model in practice: independently developed components, each released under licenses compatible with the gnu-general-public-license (GPL), could be assembled into a fully functional system. ^[FILENAME:11-11] It validated richard-stallman's long-term strategy of building a complete free operating system component by component. ^[FILENAME:9-9]

## A New Development Model

The distributed, collaborative model exemplified by linux's rapid growth — with thousands of contributors coordinating across the globe ^[FILENAME:21-21] — transformed not only the economics of software production but also the culture around it. ^[FILENAME:3-3] This set the stage for eric-s-raymond's influential 1997 essay 'The Cathedral and the Bazaar,' which articulated the principles behind this new mode of software development and helped popularize the term 'open source.' ^[FILENAME:25-25]

## Ethical Foundations and Software Freedom

The open source movement was driven not only by technical and economic considerations but by a strong ethical philosophy. richard-stallman's motivation for founding the gnu-project in 1983 stemmed from a belief that software users deserved fundamental freedoms: the freedom to run, study, modify, and share software. ^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:9-9] This ethical framing distinguished the free software movement from later purely pragmatic arguments for open source. ^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:9-9] The free-software-foundation, established in 1985, institutionalized these values and created the gnu-general-public-license-gpl as a legal mechanism to preserve software freedom for all derivative works. ^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:9-11]

## Combining GNU and Linux

The first complete free Unix-like operating system emerged when [[linus-torvalds]]'s linux kernel, released in 1991, was combined with the existing GNU system. ^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:19-19] Torvalds' choice to release Linux under the GPL in 1992 was pivotal — it ensured that the kernel and the broader GNU/Linux system remained free software. ^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:17-17] This combination demonstrated that distributed, collaborative development across thousands of contributors worldwide could produce software rivaling or surpassing proprietary alternatives. ^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:19-21]

## The Cathedral and the Bazaar

eric-s-raymond-esr later articulated the development model that had organically emerged in these projects in his essay "The Cathedral and the Bazaar," contrasting the closed, top-down development of proprietary software with the open, peer-reviewed approach of projects like linux. ^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:25-27] This framing helped popularize open source beyond the free software community and influenced how software companies approached development. ^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:31-31]

## Economic and Cultural Impact

The open source model transformed software production economically by enabling companies to build products on shared foundations rather than reinventing core components, and culturally by establishing norms around transparency, meritocratic contribution, and community governance that continue to shape the technology industry today. ^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:41-43]

## Completing the System: GNU/Linux (1991)

The GNU Project by 1991 had produced nearly all the components needed for a complete free Unix-like operating system — including the GCC compiler, the bash shell, and the glibc C library — but lacked a working kernel.^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:13-13] This gap was filled in 1991 when [[linus-torvalds|Linus Torvalds]], a Finnish computer science student at the University of Helsinki, released the  kernel.^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:17-17] Combining the GNU tools with Torvalds's kernel produced the first complete free Unix-like operating system, commonly referred to as GNU/Linux.^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:19-19] Torvalds originally released the Linux kernel under a proprietary license before switching to the GPL in 1992, aligning it with the broader free software ecosystem established by richard-stallman and the Free Software Foundation.^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:17-17]

## Eric S. Raymond and the Cathedral and the Bazaar (1997)

Eric S. Raymond emerged as a key voice articulating the open source development model, most notably through his 1997 essay *The Cathedral and the Bazaar*, which contrasted the closed, top-down development of proprietary software (the 'cathedral') with the open, peer-driven model exemplified by  (the 'bazaar').^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:25-27] His work helped popularize the term 'open source' and influenced a generation of developers and companies to adopt collaborative development practices.^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:25-31]

## From GNU and Linux to a New Production Model

The combination of richard-stallman's gnu-project and [[linus-torvalds]]'s 1991 release of the [[linux-v0-01]] kernel produced the first complete free Unix-like operating system.^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:19] By the mid-1990s, GNU tools running on the Linux kernel demonstrated that a distributed, volunteer-driven development model could produce software competitive with — and in many domains superior to — proprietary alternatives.^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:19-21]

This combination transformed software production economics and culture. Rather than centralized, closed teams producing code as a tightly guarded artifact, open source showed that geographically distributed contributors, given shared infrastructure and a clear license (gnu-general-public-license and similar), could iterate faster, find bugs sooner, and adapt software to more use cases.^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:19,29,11] The result became the dominant paradigm in servers, mobile platforms (Android), and embedded systems.^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:21]

The culture was further articulated by figures like eric-s-raymond in *The Cathedral and the Bazaar*, which argued that open development models were not just ethically preferable but technically superior — a claim that subsequent industry adoption broadly validated.^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:25,29]

## The Cathedral and the Bazaar

Eric S. Raymond's influential essay *The Cathedral and the Bazaar* (formally presented in 1997) articulated the philosophical distinction between two models of software development. ^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:25-25] The 'cathedral' model — used by most proprietary and even some [[open-source-movement|open source]] projects at the time — featured top-down, carefully planned releases built by small groups of expert developers. ^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:27-27] The 'bazaar' model, exemplified by [[linux-v0-01|Linux]]'s development under [[linus-torvalds|Linus Torvalds]], embraced open participation, rapid release cycles, and the idea that 'given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow' (Linus's Law). ^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:29-29]

Raymond's essay helped frame [[linux-v0-01|Linux]]'s success as evidence that decentralized, open development could produce software of equal or greater quality than closed, centrally managed efforts. ^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:27-29] It became a foundational text of the open source movement and influenced subsequent projects and corporate adoption strategies. ^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:31-31]

## GNU/Linux: Combining the Pieces

The combination of [[linus-torvalds|Torvalds]]'s kernel with the GNU userland tools — including the GCC compiler and other utilities developed by Richard Stallman's GNU Project — produced the first complete free Unix-like operating system. ^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:19-19] This pairing demonstrated the practical viability of the free software model: independent projects, united by compatible licensing (the GPL), could combine to form a coherent, production-ready system. ^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:17-19] The collaboration between the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory community, the GNU Project, and the Linux developer ecosystem became a template for future open source cooperation. ^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:7-7]

## Historical Framing and Origins

The open source software movement emerged from two converging currents in the early 1980s: the collaborative culture of research computing and principled advocacy for software freedom. These twin foundations produced both the gnu-project and linux kernel, which together formed the first complete free Unix-like operating system.^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:3-3]

### Research Computing Culture and Principled Advocacy

The movement's origins trace to richard-stallman's experience at MIT's AI Lab, where the hacker ethic of freely sharing code defined research computing. When proprietary licensing began restricting that culture in the early 1980s, Stallman responded with the gnu-project (1983) and the free-software-foundation (1985), articulating software freedom as a moral principle rather than merely a pragmatic choice.^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:7-9]

### GNU Toolchain and the Missing Kernel

By the early 1990s, the GNU Project had produced most components of a free Unix-like system — including gcc, the bash-shell, and glibc — but lacked a kernel. This gap was filled when [[linus-torvalds]], then a computer science student at the university-of-helsinki, released the linux kernel in 1991 under the gnu-general-public-license. The combination of GNU userland tools with the Linux kernel produced the first complete free operating system, validating Stallman's principled vision while demonstrating the power of open collaborative development.^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:13-19]

### Synthesis of Two Cultures

The open source movement thus represents a synthesis: Stallman's ideological commitment to software freedom combined with Torvalds's pragmatic, community-driven development model — later articulated in works such as eric-s-raymond's "The Cathedral and the Bazaar." Together, these threads transformed how software is produced, distributed, and governed.^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:9-25]

## Eric Raymond and the Cathedral and the Bazaar (1997)

In 1997, Eric S. Raymond published "The Cathedral and the Bazaar," an essay that became one of the most influential articulations of the open source development philosophy. Raymond contrasted two models of software development: the "cathedral" model, in which code is developed in closed, centralized fashion and released only at major milestones, and the "bazaar" model, in which code is developed openly and released frequently for broad community participation. ^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:25-27]

The essay drew on observations of [[linus-torvalds]] and the linux kernel development process as a real-world example of the bazaar model succeeding at scale. Raymond's work helped shift the broader conversation around free software toward the more business-friendly term "open source" and influenced the founding of the Open Source Initiative in 1998. ^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:35]

Together, richard-stallman's gnu-project and Free Software Foundation (with the GPL copyleft license) and Torvalds's Linux kernel — combined through distributions like Debian and Red Hat — produced the first complete free Unix-like operating system, GNU/Linux. ^[raymond-cathedral-bazaar-1999.txt:19]
