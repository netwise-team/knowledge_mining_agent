# Early Neural Networks

Early neural network research spans from McCulloch and Pitts's formal neuron model (1943) through the Perceptron (Rosenblatt, 1957), the first AI winter triggered by Minsky and Papert's *Perceptrons* critique (1969), Hopfield networks (1982), and the backpropagation revival (Rumelhart, Hinton & Williams, 1986).

## The Perceptron

Rosenblatt's Perceptron was the first trainable single-layer network. It could classify linearly separable patterns but failed on XOR — a limitation Minsky and Papert formalised, triggering a decade-long funding freeze.

## The Backpropagation Revival

The 1986 paper by Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams demonstrated that multi-layer networks trained with backpropagation could learn internal representations, reigniting interest. [[geoffrey-hinton]] continued this line of work through the deep learning breakthroughs of the 2010s.

> **Archived:** This page was an initial survey. The modern continuation of this work — [[attention-mechanisms]], [[transformer-architecture]], and [[training-techniques]] — is now covered by dedicated pages.

## Feedforward Network Architecture

A standard feedforward neural network consists of an **input layer**, one or more **hidden layers**, and an **output layer**. Each layer is composed of **neurons** (nodes), and the network is **fully connected** — meaning every neuron in one layer connects via weighted edges to every neuron in the next.^[neural-network-architecture.png:3-8] Signals flow in one direction only, from input to output, with no cycles or feedback connections. This layered, fully connected structure is the basic architecture underlying the [[early-neural-networks|neural network]] models developed throughout the field's history, from the early Perceptron through the [[geoffrey-hinton|backpropagation]]-trained multi-layer networks of the 1980s and onward. A typical diagram might show, for example, a 4-node input layer feeding into three hidden layers (6, 6, and 5 nodes) connected to a 3-node output layer, with layers often color-coded to distinguish their role in the computation.^[neural-network-architecture.png:6-17]

## Feedforward Network Structure

A feedforward neural network is organised as a series of fully connected layers, where information flows in one direction from input to output without cycles. ^[neural-network-architecture.png:3-8] A typical architecture consists of: ^[neural-network-architecture.png:10-15]

- **Input layer** — receives the feature vector (one node per input dimension).
- **Hidden layers** — one or more intermediate layers of neurons where each neuron applies a weighted sum of all activations from the previous layer followed by a nonlinear activation function.
- **Output layer** — produces the final prediction (e.g., class scores or regression targets).

In a fully connected (dense) layer, every neuron is connected to every neuron in the preceding layer via a learnable weight, making the parameter count scale as the product of adjacent layer widths. ^[neural-network-architecture.png:17] Deeper networks stack more hidden layers, enabling hierarchical feature learning — a structural principle that traces back to the multilayer networks explored after the [[early-neural-networks|backpropagation revival]] of 1986.
