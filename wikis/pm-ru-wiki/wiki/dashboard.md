# Process Mining — Dashboard

> Requires the **Dataview** community plugin (Settings → Community plugins → Browse → "Dataview").

## Contradicted pages — need review

```dataview
TABLE dateformat(created, "MMM dd, yyyy HH:mm:ss") AS "Created", status, confidence
FROM "wiki"
WHERE status = "contradicted"
SORT created DESC
```

*These pages were flagged during ingest as conflicting with a newer source.
Open each one, resolve the conflict, then change `status` to `active`.*

---

## Orphan pages — no inbound links

```dataview
TABLE dateformat(created, "MMM dd, yyyy HH:mm:ss") AS "Created", status
FROM "wiki"
WHERE orphan = true
SORT created DESC
```

*These pages exist but nothing links to them.
Orphan status is set by `synthadoc lint run` — run it first to populate this list.
Add `page-name` to a related content page to integrate it into the graph.*

## Recently added

```dataview
TABLE dateformat(created, "MMM dd, yyyy HH:mm:ss") AS "Added", status, confidence
FROM "wiki"
WHERE file.name != "index" AND file.name != "dashboard" AND file.name != "purpose"
SORT created DESC
LIMIT 10
```

---

## Recently updated

```dataview
TABLE dateformat(date(updated), "MMM dd, yyyy HH:mm:ss") AS "Updated", status, confidence
FROM "wiki"
WHERE updated
  AND file.name != "index" AND file.name != "dashboard" AND file.name != "purpose"
SORT date(updated) DESC
LIMIT 10
```

*Pages that have been re-ingested with new source material since their initial creation.*

---

## Recently archived

```dataview
TABLE dateformat(file.mtime, "MMM dd, yyyy HH:mm:ss") AS "Archived", confidence
FROM "wiki"
WHERE status = "archived"
SORT file.mtime DESC
LIMIT 10
```

*Pages retired from active use. To restore a page, change `status` back to `active`.*
