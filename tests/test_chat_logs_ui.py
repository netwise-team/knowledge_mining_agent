"""Fixture-backed UI static contracts for chat/logs/files surfaces.

Trimmed in v5.16.0-rc.2: only the fixture-backed parametrized contract
remains here. The previous CSS/JS source-string assertions (chat composer
geometry, live-card timeline, plan-mode dropdown, mobile keyboard layout,
etc.) were retired — those surfaces are exercised by the Playwright
``ui_browser`` smoke suite where it applies (`tests/test_ui_smoke_playwright.py`)
and by manual UI review for the rest. Static pin-by-string assertions
were retired with the understanding that a regression in those visual
surfaces will surface in the ui_browser CI lane rather than in unit
tests.

The shape of this file is also pinned by
``docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`` (About sub-tab note) — keep
``test_static_ui_contracts`` discoverable here and keep the fixture file
``tests/fixtures/chat_logs_ui_static_checks.json`` as its single source
of truth.
