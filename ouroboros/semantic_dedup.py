"""Shared semantic-duplicate detector for free-text items (C9.6).

The recurring defect this closes: a free-text item (a backlog nomination, a
review obligation) was deduplicated only by exact string/fingerprint match, so a
reworded restatement of the same thing slipped through as a brand-new item. This
is the ONE place that asks an LLM "is this new item the same as one of these
existing ones?" — every call site keeps its own structural fast path
(fingerprint / canonical anchor) and only falls back here after an exact MISS and
only when structural candidates exist.

Design rules (locked with the owner; see plan C9.6 / codex#8):
- Bias toward false-DUP, never false-MERGE. Merging two distinct items destroys
  information and is worse than briefly carrying a near-duplicate; so only a
  HIGH-confidence, same-root-cause/same-action match counts as a duplicate.
- Validate the returned id EXACTLY against the candidate ids (never a substring).
- Fail OPEN: empty input, no candidates, model/transport failure, or an
  unparseable reply all return None (treat the new item as new). A dedup outage
  must never block the caller or silently drop work.
- The item texts are UNTRUSTED data (they can carry prompt-injection); the prompt
  says so and the structured contract ignores any instructions inside them.
- No embeddings, no index, no generic framework — one light-model call, parsed.

Question: does NEW restate the SAME underlying {subject} as exactly ONE existing

merging? Only say so when you are confident; a wrong merge destroys a distinct
item, which is worse than keeping a near-duplicate.
