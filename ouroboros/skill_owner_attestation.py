"""C1 (v6.39): skill owner-attestation.

The OWNER may explicitly skip the EXPENSIVE LLM skill-review for their OWN (external /
self-authored) skill, or for a hash-verified official OuroborosHub payload, while the
DETERMINISTIC preflight floor still gates it. Extracted from skill_review.py to keep that
module under the size gate; it reuses skill_review's preflight + persistence machinery
(referenced module-qualified so tests can monkeypatch).
