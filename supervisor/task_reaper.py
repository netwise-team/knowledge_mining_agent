"""Variant A: off-loop worker reaper (extracted from supervisor/queue.py for module size).

The supervisor loop must stay responsive (<100ms ticks), so a timed-out task's heaviest
teardown — process kill + join (up to ~5s) + service-log archive + worker respawn (process
spawn) — runs on a single-owner background reaper thread instead of inline under the queue
lock. The loop only marks the worker ``reaping`` (so assign_tasks/crash-detector skip the
slot) and hands a fully-decided job here; ``supervisor.queue`` re-exports the thin names
(``_reap_queue`` / ``_ensure_reaper_started`` / ``_reap_timed_out_task``).
